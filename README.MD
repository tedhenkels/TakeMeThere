# Take Me There

### Goal
How often have you wondered how to spend your evening? How often have you wanted to do something but didn't know what?
You end up spending more time scouring the web for activities to fill your evening only to end up defeated and watching 
some rerun on Netflix. Worst yet, there was an even you would've wanted to go to, but you find out about it only after it
occurs. 

I've been there and that's why I decided to build a one-stop shop for events browsing in the San Francisco Bay Area. The
aim of this site is to not only inform the user of upcoming events they may like to check out but to also encourage 
users to branch out and try something new. With so many events out there it'd be a shame to miss out. 

At the moment this dream child of a project is in its infancy state whose sole purpose is to help me fill my time 
between job applications and help hone my craft as a software engineer. There are still many aspects to the site that 
still need to be completed. The initial goal is to have a simple events aggregator, pooling from the various venues in
the SF Bay Area, then I would like to incorporate personalization and allow a user to save events to their calendar.
